<p id="pp3">Air Jordans changed the whole dynamic, leveraging such a niche product to the masses via an extraordinarily talented and equally marketable athlete. It was also a pure chance that it was birthed around the same time as peak-level sports endorsements, which in itself was bigger than the Air Jordan 1.<br><br>

    It kicked off the still-strong Air Jordan signature series and is the most profitable Jordan Retro to date. Phil Knight’s chance on the young athlete paid off big time, but it wasn’t just the one event that makes this so special. This is the pillar of the entire Jordan series. Without a starting point, there wouldn’t be an anchor point to tie the championships, the MVPs and the man to. All of what happened during Mike’s life both during and post career, adds even more weight to the importance of this sneaker.<br><br>
    
    It’s importance in the entire Air Jordan range — a range that is almost single-handedly responsible for modern-day sneaker culture — is the reason why this holds such strong influence.</p><br>

    <p id="pp3">Technically advanced and bulky high-tops were the culmination of sneakers before them. But when the Air Force 1 release in 1982, everything that followed in terms of basketball footwear owed some debt to Bruce Kilgore’s 1982 magnum opus. <br><br>

        And while advancements in tech did eventually make the sneaker obsolete on the hardwood, it still didn’t die — and it probably never will. In fact, it’s become Nike’s biggest seller year after year.<br><br>
        
        So how did it go from on-court powerhouse to finding new life in the culture?
        
        Well, big brands will never admit it, but drug dealers and hustlers were the true style influencers of the era. The crack epidemic that tore apart East Coast inner cities from roughly 1984 to 1993 was the catalyst for the Air Force 1.<br><br>
        
        For the dealers, there was plenty of expendable cash on hand that needed to be spent. Chains, pagers, and rides were always the focus, but it was the shoes that became a symbol of status — for they were the most attainable adornment for your every day G.<br><br>
        
        That culture grew and blended with hip-hop, then with fashion. It’s remained a constant in an ever-changing landscape, and will likely stay that way for the remainder of our lifetime.</p><br>

        <p id="pp3">Tinker had nothing left to prove when he took on the Air Jordan 11 in 1995.<br><br>

            The dude had racked up so many classic silhouettes over the past decade and more, that he could have easily opted for something a little more, basic.<br><br>
            
            But that’s not the Hatfield way. Pushing the envelope is what has made Tinker the legend he is today. But patent leather on a basketball sneaker? You were wild for that, Tink!<br><br>
            
            The creation influenced an entire decade of patent leather popularity for sneakers. The material has now become a staple consideration of any sneaker design process. And still, over two decades later, it is one of the most popular Air Jordan Retros on the market — if not the most popular.<br>
