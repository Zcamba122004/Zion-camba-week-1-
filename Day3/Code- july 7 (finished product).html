<b style="color:goldenrod;">KOBE BRYANT</b

    <br>

 <blockquote style="color:antiquewhite;">Pairing with Shaq O’ Neal, Kobe led the Lakers to 3 peat from 2000 to 2002. Later, in 2006 and 2007, he won the scoring title. 

    Kobe is an elite scorer and ranks fourth in all-time NBA leading scorer. In the 2006-07 season, he averaged 35.4 PPG.
    
    Moreover, in 2006 against the Raptors, Kobe scored 81 points second-highest in a single game. Likewise, in his last game dropped 60 points against Jazz, most in the last game by any player. </blockquote>

     <h3 style="color:firebrick">Number 2</h3>

     <br> 
     <b style="color:goldenrod;">LEBRON JAMES</b
     
        <br>

        <blockquote style="color:antiquewhite;">Lebron joined Miami Heat in 2010 to form BIG 3 alongside Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh after winning back-to-back MVP.

            Later, he captured 2 NBA titles, 2 Finals MVP, and 2 league MVP in the Heat. 
            
            Furthermore, in the 2016 NBA Finals, Lebron James’ consecutive 41 points game and chase-down block in deciding game 7 helped Cavaliers complete a historic 3-1 comeback against GSW.
            
            Before joining the Lakers in 2018, Lebron appeared in 9 consecutive finals. After missing out in his first season, he again claimed NBA ring and Finals MVP next season. 
            </blockquote>

            <h3 style="color:firebrick;">Number 1</h3>

<br>
<b style="color:goldenrod;">MICHAEL JORDAN</b
    <br>

<blockquote style="color:antiquewhite;">The greatest player ever to play basketball is Michael Jordan. Jordan is the name that comes to mind when basketball comes. 

    Jordan’s brilliance set a standard for future generation players in the league.
    
    After winning his first NBA championship, his journey towards being the greatest began. Later, with two 3 peats and 6 Finals MVP, there is no denying why he is the goat. 
    His “Airness” Michael Jordan brought basketball back to life when its rating went to its lowest point. His Jordan brand skyrocketed the popularity of basketball. 

The 5 time MVP was an assassin in the court, taking down any opposition. Although mainly regarded as a scoring machine, Jordan was a great defender too. </blockquote>
